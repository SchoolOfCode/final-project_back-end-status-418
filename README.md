# Rootine backend API

Our SOC final project, Rootine, is a habit-tracking app that weâ€™re developing in React. This is the back-end API that links the Rootine front end to the database, which stores information about the `users` of the app, their `habits`, and the habit tracking component(`calendar`).

<br>

# Data Structure

User Table in the database is an table with the following columns:

```sql
        user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
        username TEXT,
        PRIMARY KEY(user_id)
```

-   The user table is connected to the habits table through the user_id.

<br>

Habits Table in the database is an table with the following columns:

```sql
        id INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
        name TEXT,
        description TEXT,
        userId TEXT NOT NULL,
        everyday BOOLEAN,
        frequency_reps SMALLINT,
        frequency_interval FREQ_OPTIONS,
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
        updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
```

-   The habit table is connected to the calendar table through the habit_id.

Calendar Table in the database is an table with the following columns:

```sql
      habit_id INT NOT NULL,
      date TEXT NOT NULL,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
      updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
      status STATUS_OPTIONS,
      PRIMARY KEY (habit_id, date)
```
