# Rootine backend API

Our SOC final project, Rootine, is a habit-tracking app that weâ€™re developing in React. This is the back-end API that links the Rootine front end to the database, which stores information about the `users` of the app, their `habits`, and the habit tracking component(`calendar`).

# Data Structure

User Table in the database is an object with the following properties:

        user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
        username TEXT,
        PRIMARY KEY(user_id)

- The user table is connected to the habits table through the user_id.

  Habits Table in the database is an object with the following properties:

        id INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
        name TEXT,
        description TEXT,
        userId TEXT NOT NULL,
        everyday BOOLEAN,
        frequency_reps SMALLINT,
        frequency_interval FREQ_OPTIONS,
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
        updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()

- The habit table is connected to the calendar table through the habit_id.

Calendar Table in the database is an object with the following properties:

      habit_id INT NOT NULL,
      date TEXT NOT NULL,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
      updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
      status STATUS_OPTIONS,
      PRIMARY KEY (habit_id, date)

## How to use the API, e.g. the paths to retrieve all, or perform keyword searches, etc.
